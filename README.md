    - Daily drive Arch Linux (btw) on desktop and laptop
    - Have a scuffed home server lab with a Debian mini PC as the head, connected to a NAS, primarily powered by Docker 
- 💼 **Career Goal:** Want to primarily work with Linux, but still be proficient with programming
- 💻 **Languages:** Fluent in C++, proficient in Python, learning C and JavaScript
- 📃 **Certifications:** Working towards getting A+ and Linux+ this summer
