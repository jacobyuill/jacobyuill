Hey, it's Jacob. I'm heading into my third year at the University of Tennesseeâ€”Knoxville majoring in CS. I am looking to pursue a career in DevOps after college.

My interests in tech mainly revolve around the Linux world, having first started tinkering with it at around 9 years old, with a dream to make a career out of it some day. Though, I still aim to hone my programming skills in order to remain versitile in a volatile tech market.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about any of my projects here.
